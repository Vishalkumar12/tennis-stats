Now that we have set up the project structure and created all the necessary files, let's summarize what we've built:
A TypeScript-based Node.js API with Express
Two endpoints:
GET /players - Returns all players sorted by ID
GET /players/:id - Returns a specific player by ID
Real-time data fetching from the external API
Unit tests for the service layer
Error handling and proper HTTP status codes
Clean project structure with separation of concerns
To run the application:
Development mode:
Apply to README.md
Run
Production mode:
Apply to README.md
Run
Run tests:
Apply to README.md

The API will be available at http://localhost:3000.
For the bonus task of deploying to the cloud, you have several options:
Heroku:
Create a Procfile with: web: npm start
Add a engines field to package.json specifying Node.js version
Deploy using Heroku CLI or GitHub integration
AWS Elastic Beanstalk:
Create a .ebextensions directory with Node.js configuration
Deploy using AWS CLI or EB CLI
Google Cloud Run:
Create a Dockerfile
Deploy using Google Cloud CLI
